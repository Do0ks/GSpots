## How to use

- Download the precompiled release, or build in x64-release.  
- Drag and drop the games executable onto GSpots.exe

### This will not work on EVERY Unreal Engine game...

If the games encrypted, this will not bypass it. 

As time goes on I will add more signatures!  
If you have a game that is unsupported, feel free to post in the [Game Compatibility Request](https://github.com/Do0ks/GSpots/issues/1) thread. 

# THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED WITH STEAM UE GAMES

But it should work with any..
