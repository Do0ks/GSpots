## How to use

Download the precompiled release, or build in x64-release. 

Drag and drop the games executable onto GSpots.exe

### This will not work on EVERY Unreal Engine game, yet.. 

As time goes on I will add more signatures. If you have a game that is unsupported, feel free to open a ticket requesting support. It will depend if I purchased the game or not, or if someone in the community wants to contribute the signatures. 

# THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED WITH STEAM UE GAMES

But it should work with any..
